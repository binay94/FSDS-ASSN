    "2) Enables the handling of errors: If an error occurs during the execution of the RPN script, the program counter can be used to identify the line number where the error occurred. \n",
    "3) Enables the implementation of subroutines: By using the program counter, we can implement subroutines in the RPN script, which can help make the script more modular and reusable.\n",
    "4) Provides a way to optimize the execution of the script: The program counter can be used to optimize the execution of the RPN script by identifying sections of the script that are frequently executed or that take a long time to execute."
