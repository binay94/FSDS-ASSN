If you measure the height of a large group of adult males and plot the data on a graph, you would likely get a bell-shaped curve that is symmetrical around the mean (average) height. Most adult males will have a height that is close to the mean, with fewer individuals having heights that are farther away from the mean. "

This is because probability distributions are based on probabilities and probabilities are subject to random fluctuations in the short term.
