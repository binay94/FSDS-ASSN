    "Ans: When a user enters a stock-ticker symbol, several things can go wrong. Some possible issues are:\n",

    "  => Invalid input: The user may enter an invalid stock-ticker symbol, such as a symbol that does not exist, or a symbol that is        misspelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "  => Ambiguous input: The user may enter a stock-ticker symbol that is ambiguous, meaning that it can refer to multiple different        stocks or companies. For example, \"AAPL\" can refer to Apple Inc. or Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  => Case sensitivity: Some stock-ticker symbols are case-sensitive, which means that \"AAPL\" may not be the same as \"aapl\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these issues, we can implement some error-checking and validation in our program. Here are some strategies we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Validating input: We can check if the entered stock-ticker symbol is valid by comparing it against a list of known symbols. If the symbol is not found, we can display an error message to the user.\n",
    "2) Handling ambiguity: If the entered stock-ticker symbol is ambiguous, we can ask the user to specify which company or stock they are interested in. Alternatively, we can use additional information such as the company name or stock exchange to disambiguate the symbol.\n",
    "3) Ignoring case sensitivity: We can convert all entered stock-ticker symbols to uppercase or lowercase to avoid case-sensitivity issues.\n",
    "4) Providing feedback: We can provide feedback to the user to let them know if their input was valid or not, and if there were any issues or errors. This can help the user correct their input and avoid frustration."
